# PreCue

This is a little and **ugly** app that allows you to precue tracks from iTunes.

[Download latest release](https://github.com/bcardiff/precue/releases/latest)

Open the app, choose the output device and volume to use.
Go to iTunes and press `CMD + P` or drag & drop files in the PreCue window for it to start.

This will not affect the track been played on iTunes.
It only works for songs locally stored on your computer.

Together with iTunes built-in _Up next_ playlist you are able to do some DJ-ing.
